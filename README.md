# web-scraping-challenge

In this challenge, a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars was built and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

The following outlines what has been done:

## Step 1 - Scraping
Items scraped:
* The latest News Title and Paragraph Text of Mars New Site
* The image URL for the current Featured Mars Image
* Table containing facts about the planets Mars and Earth including Diameter, Mass, etc.

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application
* MongoDB was used with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

A Jupyter Notebook file was also created containing the code.

The script for this challenge is found in the GitHub's repository on:
